👋 Hi, I’m Akash Kumar Soralle

🚀 Software Engineer | Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer
4+ years of experience building high-performance, cloud-native backend systems across finance and large-scale e-commerce.
I specialize in low-latency microservices, real-time data processing, and scalable cloud architectures.

💡 About Me

I am a software engineer with over four years of experience designing and operating mission-critical backend systems that handle real-time data at scale.

Currently, I work at Goldman Sachs, where I build low-latency Java microservices that ingest and normalize real-time market data using Kafka. These services power front-office pricing and risk analytics, so correctness, performance, and reliability are critical. I focus heavily on system design, database optimization with PostgreSQL and Redis, Kubernetes deployments, and observability.

Before this, I spent nearly three years at Amazon, working on global fulfillment and supply-chain platforms. I built backend services on AWS that handled high traffic volumes, supported inventory and shipment tracking, and integrated with Spark-based ETL pipelines and Kafka event streams for analytics and forecasting.

I enjoy owning systems end-to-end — from design and implementation to deployment and production support — and I’m passionate about building resilient, scalable systems where reliability really matters.
